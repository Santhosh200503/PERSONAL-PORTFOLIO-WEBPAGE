This project is a Personal Portfolio Website created using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript. The goal of this project is to showcase personal information, skills, projects, and contact details in a well-structured and responsive web layout. The website consists of multiple sections including an "About Me" section where the user introduces themselves, a "Skills" section that lists technical abilities such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, a "Projects" section where the user highlights their best work with descriptions, and a "Resume" section allowing visitors to download a PDF version of their resume. There is also a "Contact" section with a form where visitors can send messages. Smooth scrolling, hover effects, and subtle animations are added using CSS to enhance the user experience. The design is fully responsive, ensuring that it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. As a bonus, the website can be deployed for free on platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify, making it accessible to anyone online. This project helps demonstrate both technical skills and personal branding, and is essential for students, developers, or job seekers building an online presence.
